Before I studied in Nanjing University, I obtained B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in June 2016, where I majored in Network Engineering.\nMy research interest lies in theoretical computer science. Currently, I focus on sampling and counting algorithms. Classic topics include Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, spatial mixing of Gibbs distributions and computational phase transition. I am also interested in new problems that arised from recent applications, including dynamic and distribution sampling algorithms.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://fwm94.github.io/author/weiming-feng/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/weiming-feng/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Weiming Feng (凤维明), a Ph.D. student in the theory group in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University.
